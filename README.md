What is a firewall?
A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules.

For this project I created a basic firewall to block port 80 (HTTP), checking failed logins after 3, CPU threshold alert once it hits 90% usage. Created simulated failed login attempts from varying IP addresses, along with changing the color of the varing alert systems. Simulate events pertaining to log entries.
